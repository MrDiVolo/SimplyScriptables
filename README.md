# Simply:Scriptables
A plug and play solution for ScriptableObjects, providing a base type for scriptables, triggers and listeners.

To add this package to your project;
1) Navigate to your projects Packages folder
2) Locate and open your packages.json file
3) Add <i>"Simply:Scriptables" : "https://www.github.com/MrDiVolo/SimplyScriptables.git"</i> to the end of the file (without a trailing comma)
4) Open up and Refresh your project
5) Your packages will be re-resolved and this pacakage will be added to your project

I have also made another package that implements some default variable types and other useful features call <a href="https://github.com/MrDiVolo/SimplyScriptablesExtras"><i>Simply:Scriptables Extras</i></a>.
