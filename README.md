To add this package to your project;

3) Locate and open your packages.json file

5) Open up and Refresh your project
6) Your packages will be re-resolved and this pacakage will be added to your project

I have also made another package that implements some default variable types and other useful features call <a href="www.google.com"><i>Simply:Scriptables Extras</i></a>.
